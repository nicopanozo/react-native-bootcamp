# Digital Academy Bootcamp: Mobile Development

## React Native Movies App (TypeScript)

This is a modern React Native Movies App built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and TypeScript, designed to showcase best practices in mobile development. Powered by the [TMDb API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started), the app delivers up-to-date movie content, including trending, top-rated, upcoming, and now playing films.

Explore movies by genre, discover Marvel and action hits, and enjoy detailed information such as ratings, descriptions, and categories‚Äîall presented in a beautifully crafted interface inspired by this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1126286295256197533/movies-mobile-app-home-light-dark).

This open source project focuses on learning and applying modern React Native concepts, including custom hooks, advanced navigation, theming, animations, and type safety with TypeScript.

Developed as part of the **Digital Academy Bootcamp** at **AssureSoft**.
